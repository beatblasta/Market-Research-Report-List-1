<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Data Computer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog</li><li>Digital</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Air Data Computer (ADC) market can be classified into two main types: Analog and Digital. Analog ADCs use electrical currents to represent data, translating air pressure and temperature into analog signals. These signals are then processed and displayed. On the other hand, Digital ADCs directly convert air pressure and temperature measurements into digital signals, using binary digits to represent data. They offer higher accuracy, faster processing, and more advanced features compared to analog ADCs. Despite their differences, both types serve the purpose of providing precise and reliable air data for various applications.</p></p>
