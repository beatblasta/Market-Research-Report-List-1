<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent LED Car Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi Beam</li><li>Single Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent LED Car Light market encompasses two types: Multi Beam and Single Beam. Multi Beam refers to car lights that consist of multiple individual LEDs that can be controlled separately, allowing for precise and dynamic light distribution. This enables adaptive beam patterns and enhanced visibility on the road. On the other hand, Single Beam car lights have a fixed beam pattern and are less flexible in their light distribution capabilities. Both types are used to improve visibility and safety while driving, but Multi Beam offers more advanced features compared to Single Beam.</p></p>
