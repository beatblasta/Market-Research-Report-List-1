<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lightweight Insulating Castable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting Type</li><li>Dry Gunning Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lightweight Insulating Castable Market can be categorized into two main types: Casting Type and Dry Gunning Type. Casting Type refers to the process of pouring the castable material into a specific shape or mold, which then hardens over time. On the other hand, Dry Gunning Type involves the application of the castable material through a high-pressure gunning machine. This process sprays the material onto the desired surface, creating a dense and insulating layer. Both methods are commonly used in various industries for insulation purposes, offering different advantages based on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
