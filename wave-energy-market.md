<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Energy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oscillating Water Column</li><li>Oscillating Body Converters</li><li>Overtopping Converters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wave energy market consists of three main types: Oscillating Water Column, Oscillating Body Converters, and Overtopping Converters. Oscillating Water Column devices use the rise and fall of waves to compress air within a chamber, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. Oscillating Body Converters capture the motion of waves through a buoy-like structure that converts the movement into mechanical energy and then into power. Overtopping Converters, on the other hand, use wave energy to fill a reservoir by overtopping a structure, which drives turbines to create electricity.</p></p>
