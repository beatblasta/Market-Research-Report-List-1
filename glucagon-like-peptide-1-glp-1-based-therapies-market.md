<p><h1>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based Therapies Market Size Growing and Forecasted for period from 2024 - 2031 and provides complete market analysis of this market</h1></p><p><strong>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based Therapies Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies are a type of medication used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of insulin and suppressing the release of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar levels. GLP-1-based therapies mimic the effects of GLP-1, helping to control blood sugar levels and improve overall glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The global GLP-1-based therapies market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. The market is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, rising awareness about the benefits of GLP-1-based therapies among healthcare professionals and patients, and the introduction of innovative therapies with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</p><p>Moreover, the market is witnessing several trends that are expected to further drive its growth. One such trend is the development of combination therapies that incorporate GLP-1-based therapies with other antidiabetic medications, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. These combination therapies provide a comprehensive approach to diabetes management by targeting multiple pathways involved in glycemic control.</p><p>Additionally, the market is also witnessing an increasing preference for once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists over daily injections due to their convenience and improved patient compliance. This has led to the development of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists that provide sustained glycemic control with fewer injections.</p><p>In conclusion, the global GLP-1-based therapies market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.9% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes, rising awareness, and the introduction of innovative therapies. Furthermore, the market is witnessing trends such as the development of combination therapies and the preference for once-weekly formulations, which are expected to contribute to its growth.</p></p>
