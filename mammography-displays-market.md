<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mammography Displays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED-backlit</li><li>LCD-backlit</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mammography display market types include LED-backlit and LCD-backlit displays. LED-backlit displays use a light-emitting diode technology to illuminate the screen, offering a brighter and more vibrant display with enhanced contrast and color accuracy. On the other hand, LCD-backlit displays use liquid crystal display technology, where a backlight is positioned behind the screen to produce images. While LCD-backlit displays may have slightly lower brightness and contrast compared to LED-backlit displays, they are generally more energy-efficient and affordable options for mammography imaging.</p></p>
