<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RTD Resistance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-wire RTD</li><li>Three-wire RTD</li><li>Four-wire RTD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) is a type of temperature sensor used in various industries. The market for RTD resistance can be categorized into three types: two-wire RTD, three-wire RTD, and four-wire RTD. </p><p>Two-wire RTDs are the simplest and most cost-effective, but they can introduce measurement errors due to lead wire resistance. Three-wire RTDs are commonly used to compensate for this error by measuring the voltage drop across the RTD and two of its lead wires. Four-wire RTDs offer the highest accuracy, as they have separate wires for current and voltage measurement, eliminating lead wire resistance effects.</p></p>
