<p><p>Fresh freezers are a type of market refrigeration system used to preserve food products. There are two main types: air cooling and direct cold. In air cooling systems, cool air is circulated around the food products to lower their temperature. This method is energy-efficient and improves product shelf life. On the other hand, direct cold systems have direct contact between the food and cooling elements, rapidly freezing the products. This process is quicker but consumes more energy.
