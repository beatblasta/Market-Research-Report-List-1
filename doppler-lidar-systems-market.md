<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Doppler LiDAR Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse</li><li>Continuous Wave</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Doppler LiDAR Systems are used for remote sensing applications, such as wind measurements. These systems are categorized into two types: Pulse and Continuous Wave (CW) market. In the Pulse market, LiDAR emits short pulses of laser light and measures the delay in their reflection to calculate wind speed. Conversely, in the CW market, the LiDAR continuously emits laser light and measures the frequency shift caused by the wind to determine wind speed. Both market types provide accurate wind measurements, but the technique employed differs in how the measurements are obtained.</p></p>
