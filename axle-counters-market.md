<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axle Counters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Wheel</li><li>Without Wheel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Axle counters are used in railways to detect the presence of trains and determine their direction of movement. The market can be divided into two types: with wheel and without wheel. The "with wheel" axle counters utilize the rotations of train wheels to count and detect the passage of a train. On the other hand, the "without wheel" axle counters use electromagnetic sensors to directly detect the presence and movement of axles without relying on the wheels. Both types cater to the need for accurate train detection and monitoring in the railway sector.</p></p>
