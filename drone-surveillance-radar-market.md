<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drone Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PSR(Primary Surveillance Radar)</li><li>SSR(Secondary Surveillance Radar)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Drone Surveillance Radar market consists of two types of radars, namely Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR is used for detecting and tracking aircraft by determining their range and bearing, but it does not provide identification information. On the other hand, SSR is capable of not only detecting and tracking aircraft but also providing additional information, such as the aircraft's identification, altitude, and flight data. Both PSR and SSR play vital roles in drone surveillance, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of unmanned aerial vehicles.</p></p>
