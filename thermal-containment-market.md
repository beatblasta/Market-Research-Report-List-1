<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Containment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Aisle Thermal Containment</li><li>Hot Aisle Thermal Containment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Thermal containment refers to the practice of controlling and managing the airflow within data centers to improve energy efficiency and reduce cooling costs. Cold aisle thermal containment involves enclosing the cold aisle, where the intake air is drawn in, to prevent it from mixing with hot air. This ensures that the cold air is directed towards the IT equipment, increasing cooling efficiency. Hot aisle thermal containment, on the other hand, involves enclosing the hot aisle, where the exhaust air from the IT equipment is released, to prevent it from mixing with cold air. This helps in maintaining a higher temperature in the hot aisle, improving cooling efficiency as well.</p></p>
