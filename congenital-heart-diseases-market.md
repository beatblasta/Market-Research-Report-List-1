<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Congenital Heart Diseases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hypoplasia</li><li>Obstructive</li><li>Septal Defects</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Congenital heart diseases are categorized into three main types: hypoplasia, obstructive, and septal defects. Hypoplasia refers to underdevelopment or incomplete growth of a specific part of the heart, leading to impaired function. Obstructive defects involve the narrowing or blockage of normal blood flow in the heart or major blood vessels, resulting in decreased oxygen supply. Septal defects involve abnormalities in the walls dividing the heart chambers, causing mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood. These conditions can be present from birth and require medical intervention to manage symptoms and improve the overall quality of life.</p></p>
