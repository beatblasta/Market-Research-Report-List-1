<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Fixators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Fixators (Plates,Screws,Nails,etc)</li><li>External Fixators (Unilateral & Bilateral Fixators,Circular Fixators,Hybrid Fixators,etc)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical fixators are medical devices used in orthopedic surgery to stabilize and support broken or damaged bones during the healing process. Internal fixators, such as plates, screws, and nails, are placed inside the body and directly attached to the bone to provide stability. External fixators, including unilateral and bilateral fixators, circular fixators, and hybrid fixators, are positioned outside the body and use pins and connecting bars to hold the bone fragments together. These fixators allow for precise alignment and controlled movement of the broken bone, promoting successful healing.</p></p>
