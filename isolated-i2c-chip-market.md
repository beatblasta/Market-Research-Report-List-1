<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isolated I2C Chip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCK Mode Single Direction</li><li>SCK Mode Dual Direction</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Isolated I2C Chip market includes two types: SCK Mode Single Direction and SCK Mode Dual Direction. In the SCK Mode Single Direction, the Serial Clock (SCK) line allows communication in one direction only, from the master to the slave. This type is commonly used when the master device requires control and data transmission to the slave device. On the other hand, in the SCK Mode Dual Direction, the SCK line enables bidirectional communication between the master and slave devices, allowing data transmission in both directions. This type is ideal for scenarios where bidirectional communication is needed.</p></p>
