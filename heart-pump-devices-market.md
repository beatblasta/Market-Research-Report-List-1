<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Devices</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable Heart Pump Devices are medical devices that are surgically implanted inside the patient's body to support the heart's function in pumping blood. These devices are typically used in patients with severe heart failure or those awaiting a heart transplant. On the other hand, Extracorporeal Heart Pump Devices are external machines that temporarily assist the heart in pumping blood. These devices are commonly used during cardiac surgeries or in critically ill patients who are unable to maintain sufficient blood circulation on their own. Both types of heart pump devices aim to improve heart function and overall patient health.</p></p>
