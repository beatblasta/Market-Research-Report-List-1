<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Harvester Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture harvester tyres come in two main types: radial and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires have a belt or belts at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, providing better traction and less soil compaction. Bias or crossply agriculture tires have crisscrossed layers of ply cords, making them more affordable but less efficient in terms of fuel consumption and soil compaction. Each type caters to different agricultural needs, with farmers choosing the best option based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
