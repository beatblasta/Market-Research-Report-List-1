<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Limiting Reactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Reactor</li><li>Series Reactor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The current limiting reactor market consists of two main types: shunt reactor and series reactor. A shunt reactor is connected in parallel with the power system to compensate for capacitive reactive power. It controls high voltage, reduces overvoltage, and maintains system stability. On the other hand, a series reactor is connected in series with the power system to limit current flow. It protects equipment against damage from short circuit conditions, reduces fault current levels, and provides a stable operating environment. Both reactors play crucial roles in maintaining the reliability and efficiency of power systems.</p></p>
