<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipeline Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Measurement</li><li>Flow Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pipeline leak detectors are devices used to detect and locate leaks in pipelines to prevent any potential damage or accidents. There are two types of market segments in this field, namely pressure measurement and flow measurement. Pressure measurement detectors monitor the pressure levels within pipelines and detect any abnormalities that may indicate a leak. On the other hand, flow measurement detectors measure the flow rate of substances within pipelines, and any significant deviations from the expected flow rate could indicate a leak. Both types of detectors play a crucial role in ensuring pipeline safety and reliability.</p></p>
