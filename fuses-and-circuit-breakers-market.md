<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuses and Circuit Breakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fuses</li><li>Circuit Breakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuses and circuit breakers are two types of electrical safety devices used for protecting electrical circuits from overloads or short circuits. Fuses operate by melting a metal strip, thus breaking the circuit when a high current is detected. Circuit breakers, on the other hand, use a switching mechanism to trip and disconnect the current flow when an electrical fault occurs. Both fuses and circuit breakers serve the same purpose but differ in their operating mechanism and characteristics. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications to ensure electrical safety.</p></p>
