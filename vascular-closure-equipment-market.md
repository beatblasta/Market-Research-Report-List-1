<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Closure Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Approximators</li><li>Passive Approximators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular closure equipment refers to devices used to seal blood vessels after catheterization procedures. Active approximators are a type of closure system that involves the application of active mechanical pressure to close the vessel. These systems often use a clip or a suture to secure the closure. On the other hand, passive approximators are closure devices that work by applying pressure through an external compression pad. They do not require any active mechanical force and rely on the body's natural clotting process to seal the vessel.</p></p>
