<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Load Ball Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled</li><li>Ground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Load Ball Screws market consists of two types: Rolled and Ground. Rolled ball screws are manufactured through a cold rolling process, which provides improved surface finish but may have slightly reduced accuracy compared to ground ball screws. Ground ball screws, on the other hand, are produced by grinding the screw raceways to achieve higher precision and accuracy. Both types are used in applications requiring high load capacities, but ground ball screws are generally preferred for applications demanding utmost precision and performance.</p></p>
