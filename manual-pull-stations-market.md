<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Pull Stations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Action</li><li>Dual Action</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Manual pull stations are devices used to activate fire alarm systems manually in case of an emergency. The market types for these devices are categorized as single action and dual action. Single action pull stations require only one action, typically pulling a lever or breaking glass, to activate the alarm system. Dual action pull stations, on the other hand, require two separate actions, usually pressing a button and then pulling a lever, to prevent accidental activations. Both types serve the same purpose of initiating fire alarms, but the dual action provides an added layer of protection against false alarms.</p></p>
