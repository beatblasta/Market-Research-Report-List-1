<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helical Reducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel-axis Helical Gear Reducers</li><li>Perpendicular-axis Helical Gear Reducers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The helical reducers market consists of two main types: parallel-axis helical gear reducers and perpendicular-axis helical gear reducers. Parallel-axis helical gear reducers are designed with parallel shafts that allow the input and output shafts to rotate in the same direction, providing high torque and efficiency. On the other hand, perpendicular-axis helical gear reducers have intersecting and non-parallel shafts, providing lower torque but enabling changes in direction. These reducers find applications in various industries where torque multiplication and direction change are required.</p></p>
